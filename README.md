<h2>Internship Experience at Oasis Infobyte - Java Development</h2>

<h2>Project Description - Number Guessing Game</h2>

<p><strong>Task Overview</strong></p>
<p>In my role as a Java Development intern, my primary task was to design and implement a Number Guessing game. This classic game involves the generation of a random number, and the player attempts to guess the correct number within a specified range.</p>

<p><strong>Achievements and Responsibilities</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>User Interface Design:</strong> I was responsible for creating an interactive and user-friendly interface for the game. This included designing input prompts, feedback messages, and an overall intuitive user experience.</li>
    <li><strong>Random Number Generation:</strong> I implemented the logic for generating a random number within a specified range, ensuring a dynamic and unpredictable gameplay experience.</li>
    <li><strong>User Input Handling:</strong> My role involved developing robust mechanisms for handling user input, ensuring that the game responded appropriately to different inputs, including invalid entries.</li>
    <li><strong>Game Logic Implementation:</strong> I coded the core logic of the Number Guessing game, incorporating features such as tracking the number of attempts, providing hints to the player, and declaring the game outcome.</li>
    <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Throughout the development process, I maintained clear and concise documentation, providing insights into the code structure, functionality, and any potential improvements for future development.</li>
</ul>
